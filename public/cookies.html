                <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</strong></p>

                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how JonkaryStudio ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on the Vectorise.Me website (the "Service").</p>

                 <p><strong style="color: red;">Disclaimer: This is placeholder text. Consult a legal professional to create an accurate and compliant cookie policy, especially regarding consent requirements (like GDPR/CCPA).</strong></p>

                <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, mobile phone) when you visit certain web pages. They are used to remember your preferences, help you navigate between pages efficiently, and generally improve your user experience. Cookies can also help ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> [Only include if applicable] These cookies are essential for the operation of our Service. They may include, for example, cookies that enable session management if you had user accounts. Our Service currently primarily functions without requiring these for basic conversion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> [Only include if applicable, e.g., storing user preferences like preset choices across sessions, though current implementation doesn't do this]. These are used to recognise you when you return to our Service and remember your preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytical/Performance Cookies:</strong> [Mention if you use Analytics like Google Analytics]. These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Service when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Service works.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</strong> [Only include if you run ads]. These cookies record your visit to our Service, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We might use this information to make advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <p><strong>Specifically for Vectorise.Me (Current State):</strong> Based on the current code, the application itself might not set persistent cookies beyond potentially those set by third-party analytics (if added) or basic session management by the web server/hosting platform which are often necessary. The core functionality of upload/conversion does not rely on cookies storing user data between visits in the provided code.</p>

                <h2>Your Choices Regarding Cookies</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other websites.</p>
                <p>You can find out more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
                <p>[Consider adding information about a Cookie Consent Banner if required by regulations like GDPR].</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookie Policy on this page.</p>

                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                 <p>If you have any questions about this Cookie Policy, please contact us:</p>
