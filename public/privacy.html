                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</strong></p>

                <p>Welcome to Vectorise.Me (the "Service"), operated by JonkaryStudio ("us", "we", or "our"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

                <p><strong style="color: red;">Disclaimer: This is placeholder text. Consult a legal professional to create an accurate and compliant privacy policy.</strong></p>

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

                <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
                <h4>Personal Data</h4>
                <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email address (if you contact us)</li>
                    <li>Name (if you provide it when contacting us)</li>
                    <li>Usage Data</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Image Data</h4>
                <p>When you upload an image for conversion, the image data is sent to our server for processing. We process the image solely for the purpose of converting it to SVG format as requested by you. [**Crucial Decision Needed & State Clearly:** Do you store uploaded images or SVGs? For how long? State it here. E.g., "Uploaded images and generated SVGs are temporarily stored for processing and download, and are automatically deleted from our servers within [e.g., 1 hour] after processing."] If you do *not* store them *at all* besides in-memory processing, state that clearly.</p>

                <h4>Usage Data</h4>
                <p>We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. [Specify if you use analytics tools like Google Analytics].</p>

                    <li>To process your image conversion requests</li>
                    <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so</li>

                <h2>Security of Data</h2>
                <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data and processed images, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                <p>[Mention any third-party services used, e.g., hosting provider, analytics, email service (if using backend)].</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
